# Programming Paradigms Coursework

## Overview

In this course, "Programming Paradigms," I will explore various major computer programming paradigms, such as imperative, functional, logic, and object-oriented programming. This course is designed to compare and contrast these different paradigms, offering me a comprehensive overview of diverse programming techniques. The course's key focus will be understanding and implementing alternative programming strategies within these paradigms.

I will be using Python and its libraries to apply these concepts practically. The course will emphasize writing well-documented code, breaking down complex code into manageable pieces, and mastering nested and cryptic coding techniques. A significant aspect of the course involves developing the ability to understand code written by others and crafting my own code in a clear and comprehensible way to other developers.

## Course Objectives

- Acquire a general understanding of different programming paradigms and related approaches.
- Assess how multiple programming paradigms relate to each other and impact program development experience.
- Choose better paradigms for specified problems.
- Write programs using a single paradigm.
- Write programs using multiple paradigms.
- Decide when particular programming paradigms will and will not be a proper choice for particular problems.
